As for the velocity, we assume that the velocity in a certain cell remains constant. This means that V_i(A) could be thought as points on the velocity function. Though it might not be so realistic, this assumption enables us to simplify the calculation for the velocity (for it was only used when calculating distance) and wouldn't cause a lot of inaccuracy (meaning that it wouldn't cause much change to the total time), as shown in the graph. This is partly because the basic timestep is only 1/6 sec, a very short time that wouldn't influence the velocity and distribution of passengers much, and thus according to the formula of calculating velocity, the velocity in a certain timestep wouldn't change much, so it can be seen as a constant.
