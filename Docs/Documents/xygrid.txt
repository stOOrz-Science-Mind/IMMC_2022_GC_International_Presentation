For the Flying Wing aircraft, as we've already divided it into four blocks, we define the intersection point of the main aisle and the ith block aisle as (i, 0, 0), and the ith block aisle as its x-grid. And for the TETA aircraft, we define the entrance cell in the left as (0, 0), and the direction of the two aisles as the x-grid. The seats with a negative x-coordinate are the first class. And for the rest, passengers with seats x-coordinated 1 and 9 would board first, while those with 4 and 6 board last.
