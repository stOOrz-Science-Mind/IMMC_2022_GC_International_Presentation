As for the velocity, we assume that the velocity in a certain cell remains constant. Though it might not be so realistic, this assumption enables us to simplify the calculation for the velocity (for it was only used when calculating distance) and wouldn't cause a lot of inaccuracy, as shown in the graph. This is because the basic timestep is only 1/6 sec, a very short time that wouldn't influence the velocity and distribution of passengers much, and thus according to the formula of calculating velocity, the velocity in a certain timestep wouldn't change much, so it can be seen as a constant.
