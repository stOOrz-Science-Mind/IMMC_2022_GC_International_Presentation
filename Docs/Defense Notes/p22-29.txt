P22
We would delete seated passengers from the queue.

P23
We could get the total time combining those calculations together.

P24
The final total time is the maximum total time among all passengers.

P25
We introduced parallelity to describe how many of the aisle cells are occupied (and used). The higher the parallelity, the more efficient the system is, and the faster the strategy is. The formulae of parallelity is shown in the slide.

P26
ATS

P27
So we hope that passengers can maintain a realistic maximum speed until the passengers in the aisle begin stowing again. So we use parallelity as a factor of predicting efficiency.

P28
Mathematical deduction justified the optimality of all cells being occupied, and also justified our model. And there's another claim to appear in other aircrafts.

P29
This is the sketch map.
