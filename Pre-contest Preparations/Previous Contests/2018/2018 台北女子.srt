00:00:08,359 --> 00:00:14,307
we now have the the team from the top a

municipal Zhongshan girls high school in

3
00:00:14,308 --> 00:00:19,828
taiwan who achieved also the meritorious

4
00:00:17,339 --> 00:00:24,079
award achievement award so can we have

5
00:00:19,829 --> 00:00:24,079

31

we're from typing the new supporting

32
00:04:11,139 --> 00:04:26,019
science this is the introduction and the

33
00:04:23,288 --> 00:04:28,209
setting where that data from Taiwan we

34
00:04:26,019 --> 00:04:35,378
considered objective factors and

35
00:04:28,209 --> 00:04:38,138
personal preferences and I divided our

36
00:04:35,379 --> 00:04:40,869
report into a three part first we find

37
00:04:38,139 --> 00:04:42,720
the mortality rate second we took a lot

38
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:46,270
of foreign factors into consideration

39
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:49,239
that we can establish our model from

40
00:04:46,269 --> 00:04:56,099
five different factors alas we mark a

41
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:59,229
simulation to make it clear question one

42
00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:04,689
develop a model that uses mortality to

43
00:04:59,228 --> 00:05:07,178
measure the quality of a hospital we

44
00:05:04,689 --> 00:05:10,059
take advantage of these three data to

45
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:14,050
infer an expanded total mortality rate

46
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:16,388
after medical treatment because their

47
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:21,130
mortality can be totally different to

48
00:05:16,389 --> 00:05:25,270
two adults variants we calculate all the

49
00:05:21,129 --> 00:05:28,029
data for a to gender instead of C and we

50
00:05:25,269 --> 00:05:32,198
simply these three factors on the

51
00:05:28,029 --> 00:05:41,439
PowerPoint this is a demonstration of

52
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:46,659
our calculation F is female M is male we

53
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:49,528
try to we try to find a desktop after

54
00:05:46,658 --> 00:05:53,558
medical treatment but those that are

55
00:05:49,529 --> 00:05:56,048
confidential in Taiwan's so we automated

56
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:58,529
and that's what you can see on these two

57
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:58,530
pages

58
00:06:05,168 --> 00:06:12,059
we just divided the number of patients

59
00:06:08,499 --> 00:06:15,638
of emergency and outpatient clinic pilot

60
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:18,399
justo after medical treatment and we can

61
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:25,449
get hotel-motel arrays after medical

62
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:30,399
treatment we take the Delta of 2016 16

63
00:06:25,449 --> 00:06:33,099
for example in this chart e equals to P

64
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:36,488
times R so it's clear to see how we

65
00:06:33,098 --> 00:06:41,348
infer in the total mortality rate after

66
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:45,249
medical treatment after our calculation

67
00:06:41,348 --> 00:06:50,197
oh no after our calculation we can get

68
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:52,299
em for the to gender we can see Donna

69
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:55,449
and further to gender normal

70
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:57,939
distribution we divide the results into

71
00:06:55,449 --> 00:07:04,109
a six intervals instead of mortality

72
00:06:57,939 --> 00:07:10,869
mortality scores this is females

73
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:16,990
this is nails we conclude them in this

74
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:19,508
chart the second question is about

75
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:24,278
measuring the quality of hospitals based

76
00:07:19,509 --> 00:07:25,989
on more factors we found information

77
00:07:24,278 --> 00:07:29,768
about the reason why people choose

78
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:33,398
hospitals then we chose for these

79
00:07:29,769 --> 00:07:39,188
factors which is more objective to

80
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:41,469
create our model the first one is the

81
00:07:39,189 --> 00:07:43,589
doctor score we found information about

82
00:07:41,468 --> 00:07:47,317
top doctors from Businessweek magazine

83
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:50,738
we calculate the number of we calculate

84
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:53,490
a number of each division of top doctors

85
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:57,398
in each division of every hospital and

86
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:59,469
standardized M as X and transform X to a

87
00:07:57,399 --> 00:08:04,149
distribution from one to six point nine

88
00:07:59,468 --> 00:08:06,218
ninety a linear function to get why use

89
00:08:04,149 --> 00:08:10,538
integral functions together final

90
00:08:06,218 --> 00:08:13,567
doctoral score and take cardiology of

91
00:08:10,538 --> 00:08:17,179
hospital one for example use the wave

92
00:08:13,569 --> 00:08:22,340
above we can even get two points and two

93
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:26,330
is the is the dr. score of cardiology of

94
00:08:22,339 --> 00:08:29,079
hospital one the next one is the

95
00:08:26,329 --> 00:08:31,968
hospital score we measure the size and

96
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:35,949
resources of hospitals by the number of

97
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:39,500
pets referring to the information of

98
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:43,339
hospital evaluation we divided into six

99
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:45,919
intervals the third one is the

100
00:08:43,339 --> 00:08:48,079
recommendation score we divided into two

101
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:50,829
parts if the patient received

102
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:56,449
recommendation and get one point if not

103
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:59,359
get zero the last one is the traffic

104
00:08:56,450 --> 00:09:01,940
score it is matter about driving time to

105
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:06,499
the hospital last driving time implies

106
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:08,869
higher Travis score and last alderman

107
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:11,179
tilt his score from cousin one now we

108
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:17,029
can get a final final score of each

109
00:09:11,179 --> 00:09:25,929
hospital to get the final score we need

110
00:09:17,028 --> 00:09:28,938
to assemble a number for each bottle and

111
00:09:25,929 --> 00:09:31,219
to do that would write a questionnaire

112
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:35,630
for patients to survey how important is

113
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:39,109
extractor each row represents each row

114
00:09:35,629 --> 00:09:40,999
represents of factor we considered which

115
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:44,419
we just mentioned in the previous part

116
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:48,950
and each column represents a level of

117
00:09:44,419 --> 00:09:50,837
importance and we use zero and one to

118
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:55,310
stand for whether the patient check or

119
00:09:50,839 --> 00:09:59,060
not in this example the patient I care

120
00:09:55,309 --> 00:10:05,568
about the equipment and care a lot about

121
00:09:59,059 --> 00:10:09,199
doctors expertise and mrs. R factor

122
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:11,300
importance metrics we calculate the

123
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:14,810
factor important score by multiplying

124
00:10:11,299 --> 00:10:18,648
the score each level of the Cent's the

125
00:10:14,809 --> 00:10:21,108
sum of each row is one because each

126
00:10:18,649 --> 00:10:23,748
because patients should choose only one

127
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:26,720
option in each row and this is an

128
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:30,129
example of the factor importance for

129
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,130
apparently calculated

130
00:10:31,629 --> 00:10:37,398
then we can gather the function of each

131
00:10:34,549 --> 00:10:43,908
factor analyst and a sum up dot

132
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:46,309
revolutionist one after we got the

133
00:10:43,909 --> 00:10:48,439
propulsion of each factor I thought it

134
00:10:46,309 --> 00:10:52,669
calculate the final score for each

135
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:56,180
Hospital and each row represents a

136
00:10:52,669 --> 00:10:58,548
hospital and each ball one represents

137
00:10:56,179 --> 00:11:03,828
the score of different factors in each

138
00:10:58,549 --> 00:11:07,398
Hospital because III thus the score AI

139
00:11:03,828 --> 00:11:10,007
three is different from the others so we

140
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:13,519
use our relation matrix to transform

141
00:11:10,009 --> 00:11:17,659
auto score into the same level and after

142
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:24,380
that we can get the final spot so now as

143
00:11:17,659 --> 00:11:26,869
per our case Malaysian sorry this is mr.

144
00:11:24,379 --> 00:11:29,327
hello and he has heart disease he wants

145
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:31,969
to go to see the cardiologist but how

146
00:11:29,328 --> 00:11:35,198
can you find hospitals which fit tip so

147
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:38,660
we will give him our user-friendly memo

148
00:11:35,198 --> 00:11:41,239
okay but how can he use it

149
00:11:38,659 --> 00:11:45,309
step one has to write down his name and

150
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:48,230
his gender the division he wants to go

151
00:11:45,309 --> 00:11:52,549
the address and check the form whether

152
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:54,709
it has received the recommendation the

153
00:11:52,549 --> 00:11:58,909
most important part is filled in the

154
00:11:54,708 --> 00:12:02,179
fourth we have five factors and five

155
00:11:58,909 --> 00:12:04,939
fours on our words and with one as to

156
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:07,009
not quite at all and with five o'clock

157
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:10,670
the higher the score is the greater the

158
00:12:07,009 --> 00:12:14,239
degree is and each row is required so I

159
00:12:10,669 --> 00:12:16,697
can finish the formed and she just click

160
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,919
the Android and the nor information that

161
00:12:16,698 --> 00:12:21,827
he can get our invoice with perhaps

162
00:12:18,919 --> 00:12:26,688
became three to five hospitals for

163
00:12:21,828 --> 00:12:29,808
reference and advantage of our memo is

164
00:12:26,688 --> 00:12:32,359
that it's easy handy and convenient is

165
00:12:29,809 --> 00:12:35,179
also Baraga in the future if I have

166
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:37,879
chance to get more data we can expand

167
00:12:35,179 --> 00:12:39,909
our model or give more precise results

168
00:12:37,879 --> 00:12:43,398
to our users

169
00:12:39,909 --> 00:12:45,819
and this is the calculation behind our

170
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:45,818
model
